vax-man.py is the python code used to run the game. in order to play the game, the user must have python and pygame installed on their computer. The controls for the game are the usual arrow keys. The goal of the game is to get 'vax-man' to eat all the pieces before the system becomes too overcrowded with ghosts. Any contact by 'vax-man' with a ghost kills the ghost. After every 10 seconds when all pieces have not been eaten, the number of unvacinnated ghosts doubles.
